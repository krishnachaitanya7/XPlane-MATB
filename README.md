This is a custom Plugin in XPlane with MATB Program in QT.

# Working 
- Build the XPlane Plugin using cmake 
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
- For the Plugin to run, it needs conf file generated by MATB program. The conf file is pretty easy to read.
- For the plugin to run effectively a socket server is needed. It's main reason is to send keyboard shortcuts after a delay. Why the heck do I need to 
do something like that when I can use write delay in C++? Well the plugin and UI both seems to run in same thread. This is my personal opinion.
As this is running on same thread, whenever I use thread sleep or for that matter any type of sleep or delay functions I can find across internet
everything makes XPlane freeze, till the delay/wait is over. To overcome that this python acts as a smart callback,
send keystrokes when the delay is over. Such a herculean pain to implement a delay in Plugin. Awesome!
- Once the flight attains a cruising height this program starts changing weather according to config file it read.

This is just a preliminary readme, more detailed one need to be posted after the project gets completed. Till then if you wanna know more, you can open an issue. I can gladly answer any questions.
